            <div class="question">What is an FAQ page?</div>
            <div class="answer">Frequently asked questions (FAQ) pages are Q&A-style pages that most brands build to answer queries that slip through the cracks. FAQs are targeted to give a complete sense of query satisfaction to the client. Some examples are pricing information, cancellation queries, shipping queries, or return policies. </div>

            <div class="question">Why should you make an FAQ page?</div>
            <div class="answer">An FAQ page is a time-saving customer service tactic that provides the most commonly asked questions and answers for current or potential customers. 

                Before diving into how to make an FAQ page, you need to know why having one is so important. There are so many reasons beyond improving the customer experience for perfecting your FAQ page. Keep in mind the importance of an FAQ page when developing your own e-commerce website so you can make sure it increases sales and not the other way around </div>

            <div class="question">Where to put your FAQ page</div>
            <div class="answer">The placement of your FAQ page depends on the structure of your website. After putting so much work into your FAQ page, you don't want to hide it. Make sure your FAQ page is easy to find because when people are hunting for answers, they don't want to jump through hoops. 

                Consider putting your FAQ page on the top navigation of your website or the purchase page. You can also place it on a pull-down menu under the "Contact Us" tab. Don't try to be fancy and put it in an uncommon location; stick to where others are putting it.   </div>

            <div class="answer">Your FAQ page should address the most common questions customers have about your products, services, and brand as a whole. The best way to identify those questions is to tap into your customer service data and see which problems customers are consistently reaching out to you with. </div>
